# GiveGoSample

A sample project for showcasing to the GiveGo Team.

In this sample app, I tried my best to replicate the start up screen in the GiveGo app in a timely manner . The screen includes: PageControl with ScrollView, sign up button, login button, apply button, and the GiveGo Logo.

It was a challenge matching the sample app to the real thing. There is customization in many small details that I kept discovering. The Logo doesn't move with the scroll view, and the scroll indicators have custom colors.

In future versions I would add additional views for the Sign Up, Login, and Apply buttons that would replicate the views on the actual app. I would also get the logo with a blank background so I could place it closer to the scroll view.
